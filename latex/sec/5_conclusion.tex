\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\hspace{1pc}This paper explores the application of the BID model in brain-inspired autonomous driving. 
The model is designed to replicate the way information is processed along the brain's visual and decision-making pathways, with the goal of improving the interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving systems by mimicking neural processes. 
In addition to visual cue perception, the BID model emphasizes optimizing decision-making strategies by simulating the decision-making process of the prefrontal cortex. 
This approach of mimicking human decision-making helps autonomous driving systems strike a balance between interpretability and precision, particularly in complex traffic scenarios, ultimately enhancing safety and system robustness.
