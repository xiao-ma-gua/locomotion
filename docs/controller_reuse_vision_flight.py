# # Reuse of the trained flight controller
# 
# ### The idea is to first learn a skill (e.g. flight) by imitating the real fly behavior, and then reuse this learned skill in other related tasks.

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook shows an example of reusing a flight controller network -- pre-trained with `flight_imitation` task -- to learn to navigate in the `vision_guided_flight` task.
# 
# We will load and freeze the weights of the pre-trained (low-level) flight controller and train another high-level controller network to steer it to solve the `vision_guided_flight` task.

# 1. Observation network: module to process the visual inputs from the fly's eyes
# 2. Policy network consisting of:
#     - A high-level controller network
#     - A pre-trained low-level flight controller with frozen weights
# 4. Critic network
# 
# Once initialized, the networks are ready for training. The pre-trained controller's weight are frozen and excluded from training.
